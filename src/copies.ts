  {
    question: "What are the ways we can work together?",
    answer: "It depends on what your business needs. I can meet you where you are ‚Äì¬†from a small <strong>trial exercise</strong>; to a well-defined <strong>design project</strong>; all the way to a <strong>full-service retainer</strong>. When we get on our initial call, I make sure you‚Äôre not under- or overcommitting to anything that doesn‚Äôt fit the needs of your business. See the <a href=\"/structure\">Structure</a> page for more information."
  },
  {
    question: "When can we start?",
    answer: "From initial call to day one, in one week or less. In our initial call, we determine what you‚Äôre looking for. I then draft a scope of work for you within two days. My proposals usually suggest a start date for the following Monday. "
  },
  {
    question: "Why is fractional hiring better than full-time?",
    answer: "Startups usually hire one full-time designer, only to later realize they hired too soon (not enough work) or they hired too junior (hiring budget too low). When the hire quits or gets let go, the lengthy, costly process starts all over again. When you fractionally hire me, you get someone with 10+ years design experience, requires no training, and very little ramp time. If things don‚Äôt work out, we just stop the commitment at the end of the month."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you ensure each client gets their money's worth?",
    answer: "I dedicate as much time to a client as they need, so my roster is always small. Additionally, even if there is a desire to engage in a full-service retainer, I will always propose a <strong>2-4 week</strong> trial period with either a design project or a product audit, as a way to mutually assess if we are a good fit for one another. There are no hard feelings if we decide not to move on after the trial period."
  },
  {
    question: "Are you part of a team of designers? ",
    answer: "No ‚Äì you always work with me. You‚Äôll always get the same level of attention and service as any client that I serve, because I am a one-man business, not an agency."
